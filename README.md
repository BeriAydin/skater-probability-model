# Skater Probability Model 🛹📊

This project applies **Bayesian probability modeling** to analyze and simulate skateboard competition results using data from **Street League Skateboarding (SLS)**.

## 📌 Overview
- **Data Processing**: Cleans and normalizes competition data.
- **Bayesian Modeling**: Uses Metropolis-Hastings MCMC to estimate skaters' performance.
- **Simulation**: Predicts competition outcomes.
- **Visualization**: Includes posterior distributions and convergence plots.
